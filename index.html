                        “Reelhouse” is a subscription-based movie and TV streaming service with 15 million
                        members/users and a rotating, curated catalog of 100 movies. To provide a
                        personalized user experience and to track the popularity of certain films, genres,
                        directors, and actors in its catalog, a website with a DB backend will record its user
                        data, the ‘engagements’ films receive from its users such as views for each film/show, 
                        the ratings users give to each film, as well as the number of times a film was ‘favorited’. 
                        Each movie and show will be associated with at least one genre, director, and actor.
