# Project Overview
	“Reelhouse” is a subscription-based movie streaming service with 15 million members/users and a rotating, curated catalog of 100 movies and TV shows. To provide a personalized user experience and to track the popularity of certain films, genres, directors, and actors in its catalog, a website with a DB backend will record its user data, the ‘engagements’ films receive from its users, and the ratings users give to each film, as well as the number of times a film was ‘favorited’. Each movie will be associated with at least one genre, director, and actor. Each Television series will have a genre, actor, and director associated with its individual episodes.
